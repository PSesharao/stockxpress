How to make a request ? 

Step 1 : Run 

docker run -p 8181:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:22.0.1 start-dev

Step 2 : Go to 

http://localhost:8181/ 

Step 3 : Go to Administrative Console

Here give the Username : admin and Password : admin 

We have to now Create Realm

Give the realmname as "stockxpress"

Step 4 : Go to Clients

Click on create client 

Under General Settings

Give Client Id as  "stockxpress-app"

Under Capability Config 

Turn on Client authentication

Uncheck both Standard flow , Direct access grants

Check Service accounts roles option

Step 5 : 
We can get the client secret from the Client Credentials 

Step 6 : 
Use this client secret value in the Postman


For Zipkins : 
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin

http://localhost:9411/

If we make call to the order service from the API gateway , till order-service it will be single thread only , 
but since we have added the circuitbreaker , we see that inventory-service will be on different thread
